If you've been to any type of class before you might have come across "research" tasks. There's some classes where you spend 80% of your time doing basic internet search for question answering, to then present it to the class. This is a very common task, and what we've learned from the past is that this can easily be automated.
With the release of ChatGPT it already was easier to do this, by just typing a prompt. All relevant information would be written down in a matter of seconds, already summarized. 
But this is still inefficient, as you still have to copy& paste a lot of information given as context, inluding the question.

Auto-solve's goal is to automate this process by loading the PDF file to then automatically extract the relevant information, and then answer the question. This is done by using the [Langchain](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest) library package.
